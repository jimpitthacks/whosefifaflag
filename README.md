Additional ideas to extend this application/idea:

* Create a memory matching game, where all of the flags are hidden and you have to find 2 matching flags by flipping over only 2 at a time.
* Timing a user to see how quickly they can successfully identify all flags.
* Use the same codebase to create dynamic self-test by allowing users to supply their own JSON dataset
* Player is given 2 colours and has to list as many flaga as possible with those colours and gains a point for each correct one.
